# TrainActivity
The basic version of the 8/21/2018 assignment for UMN Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp.

This is an app to keep track of train arrival times in an upcoming schedule.  The user may add a new train to the schedule, with Name, Destination, Frequency, and the first train time of the day.  The app will calculate the next train time and minutes till the next train by using moment.js to calculate using the current time and values given by the user.

The table is updated with each entry, and values are stored in firebase, so the numbers in the train schedule are visible to users anywhere.
